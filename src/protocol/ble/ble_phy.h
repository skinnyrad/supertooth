/**
 * @file ble_phy.h
 * @brief BLE PHY-layer bitstream processor — real-time, push-bit API.
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 * This module exposes a BLE advertising packet processor that wraps two
 * sublayers:
 * 1. a framer that finds packet boundaries and collects exactly one packet's
 *    worth of on-air bits, and
 * 2. a codec step that dewhitens and assembles the decoded advertising packet.
 *
 * All state lives inside a `ble_channel_processor_t` object that you allocate
 * and pass to every call. This makes the API safe to use from an SDR RX
 * callback without any global variables.
 *
 * Typical usage
 * -------------
 * @code
 *   ble_channel_processor_t proc;
 *   ble_processor_init(&proc, 37);          // advertising channel 37
 *
 *   // Inside your SDR RX callback, per demodulated bit:
 *   ble_status_t status = ble_push_bit(&proc, bit);
 *   if (status == BLE_VALID_PACKET) {
 *       ble_packet_t pkt;
 *       ble_get_packet(&proc, &pkt);
 *       // Use pkt ...
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread safety
 * -------------
 * A single `ble_channel_processor_t` is NOT thread-safe.  Use one processor
 * per thread/channel, or protect access with a mutex.
