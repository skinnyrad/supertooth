/**
 * @file bredr_piconet.h
 * @brief BR/EDR piconet tracking — per-piconet packet queues, clock tracking,
 *        per-device RSSI accumulation, and a multi-piconet store.
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 * A `bredr_piconet_t` represents a single observed Bluetooth piconet,
 * identified by its 24-bit LAP.  It maintains a circular ring buffer of the
 * 1024 most recently received BR/EDR events.
 *
 * UAP and initial clock resolution is delegated entirely to libbtbb by the
 * calling application.  Once the UAP and an initial CLK1-6 value are known,
 * the caller invokes `bredr_piconet_set_uap()` to transition the piconet into
 * clock-tracking mode.  In this mode every subsequent header packet is used
 * to verify and — if necessary — correct the central CLK1-6 estimate by
 * checking the HEC with the known UAP and trying CLK1-6 offsets of ±1 and
 * ±2.
 *
 * Once the clock is established, incoming packets are tagged as master or
 * slave transmissions using slot parity (CLK1): even slot = master, odd slot
 * = slave. Per-role RSSI is tracked as an exponentially averaged value by
 * default (configurable, including disabled mode).
 *
 * Memory notes
 * ------------
 * Each `bredr_piconet_t` is approximately 380 KB in size (1024-packet ring
 * buffer dominates).  Always allocate piconets on the heap; never declare
 * them as local variables.  The store manages allocation automatically.
 *
 * Bluetooth Core Specification references

 * - Vol 2, Part B, §6.3   — Access code and LAP
