/**
 * @file bredr_phy.h
 * @brief BR/EDR PHY-layer bitstream processor — real-time, push-bit API.
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 * This module detects and captures BR/EDR (Classic Bluetooth) packets from a
 * raw 1-Mbps GFSK bitstream, one bit at a time.  The design mirrors the
 * `ble_phy` API: all decoder state lives inside a `bredr_processor_t` object
 * that the caller allocates and passes to every function, making it safe to
 * use from an SDR RX callback without global variables.
 *
 * Typical usage
 * -------------
 * @code
 *   bredr_processor_t proc;
 *   bredr_processor_init(&proc, BREDR_AC_ERRORS_DEFAULT);
 *
 *   // For every demodulated bit from the 1-Mbps channel:
 *   bredr_status_t s = bredr_push_bit(&proc, bit);
 *   if (s == BREDR_VALID_PACKET) {
 *       bredr_frame_t frame;
 *       bredr_get_frame(&proc, &frame);
 *       // Use frame ...
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Access code detection
 * ---------------------
 * The 72-bit BR/EDR access code (AC) consists of a 4-bit preamble, a 64-bit
 * sync word derived from the device's LAP via a (64,30) linear block code,
 * and a 4-bit trailer.  Detection uses:
 *  1. A 64-bit sliding window over the incoming bitstream.
 *  2. A 7-bit "barker code" pre-filter (bits 57–63 of the sync word) that
 *     quickly rejects most non-AC windows without a full correlation.
 *  3. LAP extraction from bits 34–57, followed by sync-word re-generation
 *     and Hamming-distance verification.
 *
 * Limitation: bit errors that fall in the LAP portion of the sync word
 * (bits 34–57) may cause a miss because the extracted LAP will be wrong.
 * This simple approach works well at low BER; use `max_ac_errors=0` for
 * the most reliable (but strictest) detection.
 *
 * Packet collection
 * -----------------
 * After the AC is confirmed, the processor drains the 4-bit trailer, then
 * collects the 54-bit FEC-encoded packet header (18 header bits repeated
 * three times — 1/3 rate FEC with majority-vote decode). Because the BR/EDR
 * header is whitened and the whitening clock is not yet known at this stage,
 * the PHY does not trust the still-whitened TYPE field to determine packet
 * length. Instead it retains the maximum possible post-access-code body for a
 * 5-slot Basic Rate packet and leaves semantic decode to higher layers once
 * UAP/CLK context exists. Payload bytes are stored raw (air order, not
 * dewhitened).
 *
 * Thread safety
 * -------------
 * A single `bredr_processor_t` is NOT thread-safe.  Use one processor per
 * thread/channel, or protect with a mutex.
